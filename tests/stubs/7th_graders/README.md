# 7th Grader Network

This network is included in the development files for testing purposes and obtained from [Netzschleuder](https://networks.skewed.de/net/7th_graders).
The data were collected by Vickers from 29 seventh grade students in a school in Victoria, Australia. Students were asked to nominate their classmates on a number of relations including the following three (layers):

1 .Who do you get on with in the class?
2. Who are your best friends in the class?
3. Who would you prefer to work with?

Students 1 through 12 are boys and 13 through 29 are girls.
